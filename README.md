ENGLISH STUDY WEB

I developed a web-based English learning platform designed to help users practice and improve their English skills through interactive lessons and real-time conversations with an AI-powered chatbot via API.
The project emphasizes a modern and user-friendly frontend, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. Users can easily navigate lessons, track their progress,
and engage with the chatbot in simulated dialogues. The design prioritizes clarity and simplicity to ensure an intuitive learning experience.

I was responsible for designing the UI, implementing interactive components, and integrating the chatbot via API, ensuring seamless communication between frontend and backend. 
This project demonstrates my ability to create engaging frontend experiences while connecting to AI-powered services.
